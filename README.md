# boi-old-azazel
A very small The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth mod for the Afterbirth DLC.


## Description ##
**TL;DR:** (Almost) restores Azazael back to his former glory. He was nerfed (way to heavily) after the last patch.

Azazael's damage and charge rate were both severely lowered to a point where it's not fun playing him anymore.

This mod tries to restore his strength (read: workaround) by giving him different starting items.

Azazael now starts with the following items:
- **The Mark**: "DMG up" (ID 79)
- **Small Rock**: "DMG up" (ID 90) OR **Cat-O-Nine-Tails**: "Shot speed up + DMG up" (ID 165)
- **Toothpicks**: "Tears + shot speed up" (ID 183)

The Small Rock version only works if you have unlocked the corresponding achievement (by destroying 100 tainted rocks). Pick the "Cat" version if you're unsure.

Credits go to otherhand42's and CallumKen's, this mod is inspired by their "unnerf" collections.

## Installation ##

Extract ONE version of this mod into your Binding of Isaac: Rebirth ```<root>/resources``` folder and overwrite existing files, if any. The included XML files will activate the mod automatically.

Enjoy!
